# SSH Terminal Implementation

## 1. Integration Overview (`ssh2` + `xterm.js`)

Cosmosh terminal path is split into control plane and data plane:

- **Control plane**: Renderer calls backend session creation through Main IPC bridge.
- **Data plane**: Renderer connects directly to backend WebSocket session endpoint and streams terminal I/O.

  API-->>UI: create-session response
  UI->>SSH: WebSocket /ws/ssh/{sessionId}?token=...
  UI-->>SSH: input/resize/ping
  SSH-->>UI: output/telemetry/pong/exit
```

## 2. Backend Session Lifecycle

### Create Session

- Route: `POST /api/v1/ssh/sessions`
- Service: `SshSessionService.createSession`
- Request fields:
  - `cols` / `rows`: terminal viewport dimensions.
  - `connectTimeoutSec`: per-session SSH handshake timeout from Settings (`sshConnectionTimeoutSec`).
- Steps:
  1. Load server record + encrypted credentials.
  2. Resolve trusted host fingerprints.
  3. Open SSH shell via `ssh2.Client.shell`.
  4. Write `SshLoginAudit` record:
     - `result = success` on successful session creation, with `sessionId` and `sessionStartedAt`.
     - `result = failed` on host-trust/auth/connect failures, with `failureReason`.
  5. Register live session state in memory (`Map<sessionId, SshLiveSession>`).
  6. Return short-lived attach token + WS endpoint.

### Attach WebSocket

- Path: `/ws/ssh/{sessionId}?token=...`
- Invalid path/token/session is rejected (`1008`).
- Existing attached socket is replaced (`1012`) to support single active attach.
- Pending output is buffered before attach and flushed after ready.

### Close Session

- API-driven close: `DELETE /api/v1/ssh/sessions/{sessionId}`
- Transport-driven close: socket close/error, SSH stream close, SSH client error.
- Dispose behavior: send terminal `exit` event, clear telemetry timer, close SSH stream/client, close WS.
- Audit finalization: update matching `SshLoginAudit` with `sessionEndedAt` and `commandCount`.

## 2.1 Connection Audit and Last-Used Sorting

- Server list payload maps `lastLoginAudit` to the latest **successful** login audit (`result = success`).
- This keeps "sort by last used" aligned with actual successful connections instead of failed attempts.
- Failed attempts are still persisted in `SshLoginAudit` for future query/audit features.

## 3. Data Stream Protocol

### Client → Server

- `input`: raw terminal input bytes as UTF-8 string.
- `resize`: terminal cols/rows with bounded normalization.
- `ping`: heartbeat.
- `close`: explicit disconnect request.

### Server → Client

- `ready`: attach acknowledged.
- `output`: shell stdout/stderr output.
- `telemetry`: CPU/memory/network + command history snapshot.
- `pong`: ping response.
- `error`: protocol/runtime error.
- `exit`: terminal session closed with reason.

  SSH --> OUT[shell stdout/stderr]
  OUT --> WS2[WebSocket output event]
  WS2 --> XT2[xterm.write]
```

## 4. Host Verification & Trust Flow

- SSH connect uses `hostHash: 'sha256'` and `hostVerifier`.
- If fingerprint is unknown:
  - backend returns `SSH_HOST_UNTRUSTED` payload.
  - renderer opens trust dialog.
  - user confirmation calls trust endpoint.
  - renderer retries create-session.

## 5. Exception Handling & Reconnect

### Current Behavior (Implemented)

- Session attach timeout: 30s.
- Any socket close/error transitions UI state to failed.
- Retry is **manual** via UI retry button (`SSH.tsx`), which creates a new session.
- No automatic exponential reconnection loop is implemented yet.

### Recommended Next Step (Planned)

- Add bounded auto-reconnect only for transient WS transport failures.
- Keep host-verification and auth failures as terminal (non-retriable) errors.

## 6. Performance Strategies in Current Code

- Renderer binds Settings `sshMaxRows` to xterm `scrollback` when initializing SSH terminal.
- Renderer uses `FitAddon` + resize observer to keep shell size synchronized.
- Backend normalizes terminal sizes to prevent extreme allocations (`20-400 cols`, `10-200 rows`).
- Pending output queue avoids losing early SSH output before WS attach.
- Telemetry sampling is interval-based (5s) and lightweight text parsing to reduce per-frame cost.
- Command capture keeps bounded input buffer (512 chars per active line).

## 7. Developer Debug Checklist

When SSH session behavior is wrong, verify in order:

1. Session creation API payload and validation path.
2. Host verification branch (`SSH_HOST_UNTRUSTED` vs direct session creation).
3. WS attach token/sessionId matching.
4. Stream direction integrity (`input` write and `output` flush).
5. Session disposal path (API close vs transport close vs SSH error).

## 8. Windows Context-Launch to Local Terminal CWD

- Installer integration can register `Open terminal in Cosmosh` in Explorer context menus.
- Installer writes shell verb metadata (`MUIVerb`, icon) for Explorer context menu compatibility.
- Explorer launches Cosmosh with `--working-directory <path>`.
- When terminal-app registration is enabled, installer also generates `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\cosmosh.cmd` as a stable CLI launcher shim.
- Main process parses this argument and keeps it as one-shot pending launch context.
- Renderer launch behavior is controlled by Settings `terminalContextLaunchBehavior`:
  - `openDefaultLocalTerminal`: auto-opens an SSH tab with the default local terminal profile.
  - `openLocalTerminalList`: opens Home and focuses the Local Terminals group.
  - `off`: ignores context-launch auto-navigation.
- When `openDefaultLocalTerminal` is enabled, profile selection honors Settings `defaultLocalTerminalProfile` (`auto` or a concrete profile id loaded from current local terminal profiles) and falls back to first available profile.
- If Cosmosh is already running, `second-instance` pushes launch context to renderer via IPC event.
- `second-instance` resolution uses both CLI args and Electron `workingDirectory` as fallback, reducing context-loss cases where only focus happened.
- On local terminal session creation (`POST /api/v1/local-terminals/sessions`), Main forwards `cwd` once.
- Backend validates `cwd` and falls back to `os.homedir()` when path is invalid or inaccessible.

## 9. macOS CLI Context-Launch to Local Terminal CWD

- On packaged macOS builds, Main prepares a user-level launcher script at `~/Library/Application Support/Cosmosh/bin/cosmosh`.
- The launcher invokes the app executable with `--working-directory "$PWD"`, so terminal launch context is inherited from the current shell directory.
- Main tries to create a symlink to that launcher in common PATH locations (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`) without requiring runtime crashes on permission failures.
- If symlink creation fails due to permission restrictions, app startup continues and warns in logs; users can add the launcher directory to PATH or create a symlink manually.
- Once launched, context handling path is identical to Windows: Main resolves pending launch cwd and forwards it into the next local terminal session creation.
